## 🔬 Overview

The Chemistry Department's original inventory system consists of multiple legacy files with inconsistent formats, missing values, duplicate records, and differing data structures.

This project aims to replace that fragmented system with a unified Python application that can:

* Analyse and clean the existing inventory data.
* Migrate reagent and equipment records into a consistent JSON structure.
* Manage inventory items through an object-oriented model.
* Load and save inventory data reliably.
* Generate useful inventory reports using functional programming techniques.

The application is being developed collaboratively using Git and GitHub, with individual contributions tracked through version control.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1. **Analyse legacy data** — Identify inconsistencies, formatting issues, missing values, and duplicate records.
2. **Design a unified schema** — Establish a consistent JSON structure for reagents and laboratory equipment.
3. **Implement data migration** — Build a migration script that cleans, normalises, and consolidates the original datasets.
4. **Apply object-oriented programming** — Develop reusable classes and an inventory management system.
5. **Implement persistence** — Support reliable loading and saving of inventory data.
6. **Develop functional reporting** — Use appropriate functional programming constructs to produce useful inventory reports.
7. **Maintain code quality** — Follow modular design principles and use Git checkpoints to document development.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is expected to follow this structure:

```text
chemistry-inventory-management/
│
├── legacy_inventory.csv    # Legacy reagent dataset
├── legacy_equipment.json   # Legacy equipment dataset
│
├── migrate.py              # Data cleaning and migration
├── app.py                  # Object-oriented inventory application
├── inventory.json          # Unified inventory data
│
├── README.md               # Project documentation and report
└── .gitignore              # Files excluded from version control
```

*The structure may be adjusted as the project develops. The legacy files should be included only where permitted by the assessment requirements.*

## 🔄 Data Migration

The `migrate.py` script is responsible for transforming the supplied legacy datasets into a single, consistent JSON inventory.

The migration process is intended to cover:

* Reading the CSV and JSON source files.
* Normalising field names, casing, and data formats.
* Cleaning and standardising dates and quantities.
* Validating and standardising reagent identifiers.
* Handling missing or invalid values consistently.
* Identifying and merging duplicate records according to documented rules.
* Exporting the final unified dataset to `inventory.json`.

The migration rules and unified schema will be documented in the project report.

## 🏗️ Object-Oriented Design

The main application, `app.py`, will use an object-oriented architecture to represent and manage inventory items.

The planned design includes:

* **`InventoryItem`** — An abstract base class defining the common interface and attributes shared by all inventory items.
* **`Reagent`** — A subclass representing chemical reagents and their specific attributes.
* **`Equipment`** — A subclass representing laboratory equipment and its specific attributes.
* **`InventoryManager`** — A class responsible for managing inventory collections, loading data, saving changes, and coordinating inventory operations.

This structure is intended to demonstrate abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while keeping the application modular and maintainable.

## 📊 Functional Reporting Features

The application will include two functional reporting methods designed to demonstrate appropriate use of functional programming concepts.

Potential techniques include:

* **Filtering:** Selecting inventory records that match particular conditions.
* **Mapping:** Transforming inventory data into a report-friendly representation.
* **Sorting:** Ordering records by relevant attributes.
* **Lambda expressions:** Defining concise functions for sorting and filtering.
* **Higher-order functions:** Passing functions into operations that process inventory collections.

The final reporting features will be documented here once the implementation and requirements have been confirmed.

## 🌿 Development Workflow

Development is managed through a shared Git repository. Each team member is responsible for committing their own work using their own Git identity.

The project follows the assessment's required development checkpoints:

1. Finalise and document the unified JSON schema.
2. Implement reading of both legacy files.
3. Complete the data-cleaning rules.
4. Implement duplicate merging.
5. Generate `inventory.json`.
6. Implement the abstract base class and subclasses.
7. Implement inventory loading and saving.
8. Implement the first functional reporting method.
9. Implement the second functional reporting method.

Checkpoint commits should clearly describe the completed work and accurately reflect the responsible contributor.

Example commit messages:

```text
docs: finalise unified inventory schema
feat: implement legacy data loading
feat: complete inventory data cleaning
feat: implement duplicate merging
feat: generate unified inventory dataset
feat: implement inventory item class hierarchy
feat: add inventory persistence
feat: implement first reporting method
feat: implement second reporting method
```

## 👥 Team Contributions
